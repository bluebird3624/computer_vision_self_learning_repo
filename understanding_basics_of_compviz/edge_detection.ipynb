    "### What is Edge Detection?\n",
    "Edge detection identifies boundaries in an image where there’s a significant change in pixel intensity, often corresponding to object boundaries. Edges are critical for tasks like object recognition, segmentation, and feature extraction.\n",
    "How Edge Detection Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Edges are detected by computing the gradient of the image intensity, which measures the rate of change in pixel values.\n",
    "Gradients are typically calculated using first derivatives (e.g., Sobel operator) or second derivatives (e.g., Laplacian).\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Edge Detection Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sobel Operator:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Uses two 3x3 kernels to compute gradients in the x- and y-directions:\n",
    "    $$G_x = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ -2 & 0 & 2 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, \\quad G_y = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 & -2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 2 & 1 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Gradient magnitude: $ G = \\sqrt{G_x^2 + G_y^2} $\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Application: Robust for noisy images, used in autonomous driving for lane detection.\n",
    "    - Pros: Simple and computationally efficient.\n",
    "    - Cons: Sensitive to noise unless combined with smoothing.\n",

    "- Canny Edge Detector:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - A multi-step algorithm, considered the gold standard for edge detection:\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. Noise Reduction: Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.\n",
    "        2. Gradient Computation: Use Sobel-like filters to find intensity gradients.\n",
    "        3. Non-Maximum Suppression: Thin edges by suppressing non-maximum gradient values.\n",
    "        4. Double Thresholding: Classify edges as strong, weak, or non-edges using two thresholds.\n",
    "        5. Edge Tracking by Hysteresis: Connect weak edges to strong edges if they’re connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Parameters: Low and high thresholds, Gaussian kernel size.\n",
    "    - Application: Precise edge detection in medical imaging (e.g., detecting tumor boundaries).\n",
    "    - Pros: Robust to noise, produces clean edges.\n",
    "    - Cons: Parameter tuning (thresholds) can be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG):\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Applies a Gaussian blur followed by the Laplacian operator to detect edges via zero-crossings.\n",
    "    - Kernel combines smoothing and second-derivative computation.\n",
    "    - Application: Used in feature detection for computer vision.\n",
    "    - Cons: Sensitive to noise without proper smoothing."
