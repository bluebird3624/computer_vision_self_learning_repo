    "### Connections Between Filtering, Edge Detection, and Thresholding\n",
    "These techniques are often used together in image processing pipelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Filtering: Preprocesses the image to reduce noise (e.g., Gaussian blur) or enhance features (e.g., sharpening).\n",
    "2. Edge Detection: Identifies boundaries, often after filtering to improve accuracy.\n",
    "3. Thresholding: Converts the edge-detected or filtered image into a binary image for segmentation or further analysis.\n",

    "### Example Workflow: Object Segmentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise.\n",
    "- Use Canny edge detection to find object boundaries.\n",
    "- Threshold the edge map to create a binary mask.\n",
    "- Use the mask to isolate the object from the background."

    "- Color Images: For RGB images, apply techniques to each channel separately or convert to grayscale/HSV for processing. For example, thresholding the V-channel in HSV is effective for brightness-based segmentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Noise can distort results; always preprocess with appropriate filters.\n",
