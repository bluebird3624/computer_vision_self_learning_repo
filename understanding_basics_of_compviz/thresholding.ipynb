    "### What is Thresholding?\n",
    "Thresholding converts an image (usually grayscale) into a binary image by assigning pixel values to either black or white based on a threshold value. Pixels above the threshold become one value (e.g., white), and those below become another (e.g., black).\n",
    "#### Types of Thresholding\n",
    "\n",
    "- Global Thresholding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Uses a single threshold value for the entire image.\n",
    "    - Example: If $ T = 128 $, pixels with intensity $\\geq 128$ become 255 (white), and others become 0 (black).\n",
    "    - Pros: Simple and fast.\n",
    "    - Cons: Fails with uneven lighting or complex backgrounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adaptive (Local) Thresholding:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Applies different thresholds to different regions based on local image statistics (e.g., mean or Gaussian-weighted mean of a neighborhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "        Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "        - Adaptive Mean Thresholding: Threshold is the mean of a local window minus a constant.\n",
    "        - Adaptive Gaussian Thresholding: Uses a Gaussian-weighted mean for smoother results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Application: Document scanning with varying lighting conditions.\n",
    "    - Pros: Handles non-uniform illumination.\n",
    "    - Cons: Computationally more intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Otsu’s Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Automatically determines the optimal global threshold by minimizing intra-class variance of the resulting binary image.\n",
    "    - Assumes a bimodal histogram (two distinct intensity peaks).\n",
    "    - Application: Separating objects from backgrounds with clear intensity differences.\n",
    "    - Pros: Automatic threshold selection.\n",
    "    - Cons: Less effective for images without bimodal histograms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- How Thresholding Works\n",
    "\n",
    "    For a grayscale image with pixel intensities $[0, 255]$, a threshold $ T $ is applied:\n",
    "    $$\\text{Output}(x, y) = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "    255 & \\text{if } \\text{Image}(x, y) \\geq T \\\\\n",
    "    0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive thresholding computes $ T $ for each pixel based on its local neighborhood."
